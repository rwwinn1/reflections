When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So that others can see your code and contribute. Also so that reviews of code can be performed easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be changes made in github that you don't want in your local repository. In other words, you may want to review any
changes in your remote repository before pulling them into your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch exists in your local repository. A clone is a copy of an entire repository that can come from your local machine
or from a remote repository and can go to your local machine or a remote repository. A fork is a clone of someone else's repository
on github to a new repository for you on github.
