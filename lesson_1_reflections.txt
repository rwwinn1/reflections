How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
You are able to see the versions "side-by-side" which helps find the bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can always go back in time if needed in order to use work that was already done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
This allows the developer to make commits only when a logical change has been made to the code base.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because the purposes of each system differ. Single files with no relation to others is what Google Docs is designed for.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to get a list of commmits. Use git diff to compare one commit with another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can always go back!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to keep track of my code history so that I can go back if needed.
